			<h2> Examining MLB barrel% </h2>
			<h4> To be Barreled, a batted ball requires an exit velocity of at least 98 mph. At that speed, balls struck with a launch angle between 26-30 degrees always garner Barreled classification. For every mph over 98, the range of launch angles expands.<br/><br/>Justin Girshon </h4>

<p>Aaron Judge stepped into the batter's box with the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays tied 3-3 in the top of the seventh inning at the Rogers Centre on Sept. 28, 2022, versus left-handed pitcher Tim Mayza.</p>

<p>Mayza had just let up a leadoff single to Aaron Hicks, so when the Yankees’ order flipped from its last hitter to Judge leading off, the Blue Jay tried working meticulously around the slugger. Judge was bombarded with pitches low inside, but Mayza’s command was inconsistent, as the count drew full after five pitches.</p>

<p>After Judge fouled off two pitches consecutively, the count remained full. Then on Mayza’s eighth delivery, he made a mistake. Judge made him pay. By barreling the ball, Judge pulled the ball over the left wall with a 117.8 mile per hour exit velocity — one of the hardest hit balls of his career. </p>

<p>The swing was a testament to what Judge had done best all season. As he tied Roger Marris’ home run record, he barreled the ball. In 2022, Judge’s 26.5% barrel percentage led MLB, helping him put together one of the best offensive seasons in the sport’s history.</p>

<p>“You can make the argument that since literally the beginning of baseball a batter’s mentality and their approach is to try to barrel a baseball,” said Jonah Soos, the President of Syracuse University’s Baseball Sabermetrics Club. “It's always been there and players have always been quantified and justified by how hard they can hit a baseball.”</p>

<p>For as long as baseball has existed, a player’s main goal when batting is to get on base — in any way possible. The most prevalent way of getting on base is by getting a hit, but that’s far more complex than it sounds. There are four ways to get a hit: a single, double, triple or home run. Though the way of having a batted ball results in that outcome can come in many particular ways. Unlike in basketball, a perfect shot doesn’t always result in points. In baseball, a lightly hit ball can loop in front of a fielder for a base hit. The best way of getting a base hit? Hitting the ball hard — which usually entails barreling the ball.</p>

<h3>Barrel % explained simply by Simple Sabermetrics on YouTube </h3>

<p>“People have always looked for batters that hit balls hard,” Soos said. “That's really all that barrels are: how hard can you hit a ball how much exit velocity can you hit a ball at.”</p>

<p>Though barrels have always existed within baseball, they only began picking up mainstream prevalence within the last decade. One of the most transforming moments of baseball’s recent history was the implementation of high-speed cameras in stadiums. The trial began in 2014 and after resounding success, they were installed in all 30 MLB stadiums ahead of the 2015 season.</p>

<p>This began the “Statcast Era.”</p>

<h3>When players barrel the ball, they tend to hit for higher exit velocities which result in succssful at bats --- like Bobby Witt Jr. did on Aug. 21, 2023</h3>

<p>One of the biggest forms of scouting at in the major leagues, minor league, collegiately and high school players was the “eye test” — where scouts evaluated players mainly with their own thoughts and opinions.</p>

<p>“Barrels have been around really forever, but they've not been like super tracking quantified until 2015, 2016,” Soos said.</p>

<p>With the new technology and high-speed technology, scouts can now evaluate with numbers, too. One of these figures is barrel percentage — which the majority of the best offensive players in MLB thrive in.</p>

<iframe title="Barrel% correlation to wOBA MLB 2019-23
" aria-label="Interactive scatter chart" <iframe title="Barrel% correlation to wOBA MLB 2019-23" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-z7RKP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z7RKP/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="302" data-external="1"> </iframe>


<p>Barrel percentage is a useful statistic because it helps players hit for more power. While every player’s goal is to get a hit every at bat, not all outcomes are created equally. A double is better than a single, a triple is better than a double and a home run is better than a triple. To maximize how well a player hits the ball, barrelling it is very helpful.</p>


<p>“For batters specifically, it's all about understanding yourself as a hitter and what you're trying to accomplish,” Soos said. “So it's using those advanced stats to try to be best at making an impact to your team because, at the end of the day, it's all about winning.”</p>

<p>Additionally, another way to maximize power is by pulling the ball. Players with higher barrel percentages tend to pull the ball more than players who struggle hitting barrels. Because power is also correlated with barrels, pulling the ball also helps maximize the best outcome for an at bat.</p>

<iframe title="Barrel% correlation to Pull% MLB 2019-23" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-F912M" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F912M/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="428" data-external="1"></iframe>

<p>“Players can of course, go the opposite way but you're able to put so much more torque into pulling the ball,” Soos said. “So you're gonna have more barrels because you're going to hit it harder… Most people like to pull the ball now because they know they can hit it harder.”</p>

<p>Because of all the new technology and emphasis on advanced stats like barrel percentage, players have begun finding ways to best utilize this data. A big part behind hitting the ball? A player’s bat. So, players have begun finding ways to best cater a bat to their swing so they can find as much success as possible.</p>

<p>In an article published by <a href="https://theathletic.com/4164755/2023/02/10/mlb-personalized-bats-austin-riley-marrucci-sports/"rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Athletic</a> on Feb. 10, 2023, Ken Rosenthal dives into the area. One of the players Rosenthal provides insight on is Judge’s teammate Anthony Rizzo. Like most players, Rizzo wanted to optimize his barrel percentage. So, he got into the hitting lab and found his best sweetspot.</p>

<p>“Rizzo’s got a 33-inch bat that swings like his 34 1/2-inch game bat. It’s basically relocating that barrel closer to his hands for a right-handed reliever that is going to run a cutter up under him,” the article says.</p>

<p>As players begin relying more and more on data, they must find edges to best optimize their barrel percentage. Pitchers have continuously gotten better year over year. The best way for hitters to keep up with them is to continue leaning on the new-age data to help optimize their swings and thus their barrel percentage.</p>
